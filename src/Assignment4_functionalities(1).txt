   FROM member m JOIN reservation r ON m.ID = r.BookedBy JOIN facility f ON f.FacName = r.FacName GROUP BY m.ID;


2. SELECT mf.Member1, mf.Member2, m.MemberName, r.StartTime 
   FROM memberfriendlist mf JOIN reservation r ON mf.Member2 = r.BookedBy JOIN member m ON mf.Member2 = m.ID 
   WHERE mf.Member1 = 8 AND date(r.StartTime) > '2021-02-20' AND date(r.StartTime) < '2021-02-27';


3. SELECT * 
   FROM reservation 
   WHERE BookedBy = 8 and EndTime BETWEEN date_sub(now(), INTERVAL 7 day) and now();

4. 
   SELECT m.Gender, m.MembershipTier, count(m.ID) as ReservationCount 
   FROM reservation r JOIN member m ON r.BookedBy = m.ID  
   GROUP BY m.MembershipTier, m.Gender 
   ORDER BY m.MembershipTier;



# of F and M in each tier
   SELECT Gender, MembershipTier, COUNT(ID) as MemberCount 
   FROM member 
   GROUP BY MembershipTier, Gender 
   ORDER BY MembershipTier;
